        <h1> My name is Joshua Thatcher</h1>
        <h2>These are three of my top artist inspirations</h2>

        <a href="https://www.ghibli.jp/"><h3> Hayao Miyazaki</h3></a>
        <img src="img/miyazaki.jpg" alt="hayao miyazaki smiling at an event">
        <p>The first artist on my inspirations list is Hayao Miyazaki, a legendary filmmaker and animator who created Studio Ghibli and some of the arguably best animated films.
            <br> 
            I love how he takes animation and creates his own style out of it, with many of his films evoking a very unique “Ghibli” feel. 
            <br> 
            He tackles heavier themes in many of his films, despite them being colorful and playful, such as his film “Princess Mononoke”, 
            <br> 
            which is a beautiful film about the destructive effects humankind has on nature, and his upcoming film, “The Boy and the Heron”, about a small boy’s loss and grieving of his mother.
            <br>  
            His films create a beautiful world both audio and visual that is really inspiring. </p>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hanszimmer/"><h3> Hans Zimmer</h3></a>
        <img src="img/zimmer.jpg" alt="portrait of hans zimmer">
        <p>The second artist on my list is Hans Zimmer, another artist that I have followed for years as I have grown up with much of his work. 
            <br>
            He is a film score composer with a huge line of work reaching back into the 90’s.
            <br> 
            He is the composer for all of the music for iconic movies such as “Interstellar”, “Inception”, and even older movies such as “The Lion King”.
            <br> 
            While his music does have a signature feel in some of his pieces, I find it so inspiring how he is able to mold music to fit the movie, genre, time period, and scene so fittingly.
            <br> 
            You can easily describe the movie he composes for based off of simple melodies that he creates,
            <br> 
            but nonetheless his scores go on to become instantly recognizable such as “Time” from “Inception”, which has gone on to become a recognizable tune even on TikTok and Instagram feeds.</p>
        <a href="https://franklloydwright.org/"><h3> Frank Lloyd Wright</h3></a>
        <img src="img/wright.jpg" alt="Frank Lloyd Wright sitting in a chair">
        <p>The last artist on my list is one that is much newer to me so I am still becoming familiar with more of his work, but Frank Lloyd Wright has become one of my favorite designers simply due to his architectural work on “Falling Water” in Mill Run, PA. 
            <br>
            This building is one of the most aesthetic examples of the fusion between urban and nature, and one that I aspire to have in my home. 
            <br>
            His building gracefully and beautifully melds the structure interwoven with the forest and nature around it, with a natural waterfall flowing directly through the structure. 
            <br>
            I find his ability to weave nature into his work really inspiring.</p>

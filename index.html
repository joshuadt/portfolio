            <h4>I am a Visual Communication and Design junior at SFSU with an interest in UX/UI design.
                <br>
                I have a broad interest in many different forms of art, ranging from music and film, 
                <br>
                to video games, architecture, and standard graphic and interface design.
                <br>
